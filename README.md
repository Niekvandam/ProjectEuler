   # ProjectEuler

The goal is to finish the first 100 challenges of project euler in this repository. Afterwards I will continue in a prive repository to not break [the rules](https://projecteuler.net/about) of project euler. 

During these challenges, my personal goal is to improve my logical thinking, and mathematical skills.
